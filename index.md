## [Introduction](https://lltommy.github.io/pagesPlayground/introduction)

### Who this guide is designed for
This guide primarily focuses on data practitioners in the clinical field such as clinical data managers or analysts. The secondary audience are data practitioners in (a) the research domain interested in the clinical and healthcare domain, such as research and registry data curators, terminology managers or bioinformaticians or (b) the post authorization domain, i.e. medical affairs, market access with the interest to compare clinical results with real-world outcomes. 

Since clinical trial and health care data is primarily determined by regulatory requirements or healthcare processes respectively, this guide is of interest foremployees in pharmaceutical companies, healthcare organisations such as hospitals or medical centres and clinical regulators such as the FDA and EMEA.

### Context of this guide: Clinical Data Challenges and Opportunities
We are faced with the tremendous challenge of realising the full value of clinical and healthcare data and associated metadata. This challenge is caused by the complexity and diversity of clinical data types and clinical standards, combined with the sheer volume of clinical data (see section Clinical study data can be big!) and regulatory requirements. Additionally, this data is often locked away in proprietary containers which limit or prevent access and reuse. 

Clinical data re-use beyond the primary intent of collection is challenging also for regulatory implementation which protects patient data and limits what can currently be done, and how, with clinical data. On the one hand patient’s privacy must be protected but on the other hand also their wish to share some of their data to enable new and better therapies should be respected. An additional challenge to be met is to protect but also to promote public health through data. 

Drug repurposing efforts in the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Vodan) illustrate the urgent needs and persisting challenges of reusing clinical trials and healthcare data to generate insights. Being able to search, retrieve and integrate data from different clinical trials and to link it to Real World Evidence (RWE) is critical to success. Furthermore, interoperability is crucial when clinical study data needs to be integrated and connected across different clinical studies. 

Time is of the essence to bring valuable therapies to market as soon as possible to address unmet needs for patients. Innovative pharmaceutical companies also have a commercial interest to shorten the development times as much as possible. The immense cost and vital importance of clinical data are a motivation, if not an obligation to make this data FAIR, which means: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by humans as well as machines.

### Purpose of this guide: From Awareness to Making Pragmatic Choices 
The importance of the FAIR principles [Wilkinson et al. 2016] is well recognised amongst researchers in academia and industry, but its implementation is not yet mature in the clinical domain  [Kubben et al.  2019]. This guide aims to raise awareness of the value of FAIR clinical data. It is designed to facilitate pragmatic decision making based on FAIR clinical data and metadata management, which is addressed in Section 2 (Metadata). Topics such as data governance and additional facets of data management such as quality and training are presented in Section 3 (Application). The best practices in data management (“bottom-up”) and strategic data governance (“top-down”) are foundational for achieving a deeply integrated data-centric culture to serve communities of users and stakeholders in the life science industry.
